# Analysis of Probabilistic Models in Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing 91 variables and 3,000 observations using machine learning techniques, specifically probabilistic and embedded methods. The main objective is to predict a target variable with three possible categorical values: 0, 1, or 2.

## Methods Employed

The following machine learning methods were applied:

- **Naive Bayes**
- **Augmented Naive Bayes**
- **Discriminant Analysis** (LDA and QDA)
- **Bagging**
- **Random Forest**
- **AdaBoost**
- **Gradient Boosting**

## Feature Selection Techniques

To improve model performance, a series of feature selection techniques were employed:

- **ANOVA**
- **Mutual Information**
- **Lasso**

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of the models listed above in terms of:

- **Accuracy**
- **Computational Efficiency**

The project also focuses on:

- Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Optimizing feature selection to enhance predictive capabilities.

## Results and Insights

The project aims to provide a detailed analysis of the models' performance, identifying the most effective approach for predicting the target variable
