# Analysis of Probabilistic Models in Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze a dataset with 91 variables and 3000 observations using machine learning techniques, focusing on probabilistic methods (Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis) and ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting). The objective is to predict a categorical target variable with three possible values (0, 1, and 2). The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of various machine learning models to optimize prediction accuracy.

Key methods used in the analysis include:
- **Probabilistic models**: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Augmented Naive Bayes, and Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA)
- **Ensemble methods**: Bagging (including Random Forest) and Boosting (AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting)
- **Feature selection**: Filtering, wrapper, and embedded methods (ANOVA, mutual information, and Lasso)

The goal is to compare the performance of these techniques and identify the most effective approach for classifying the target variable.
