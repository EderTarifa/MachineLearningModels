# Prediction of Hotel Reservations Using Neural Networks

This project aims to predict hotel reservation cancellations by building and training a neural network model. The objective is to accurately classify reservations as either "canceled" or "not canceled" using a dataset containing 36,270 observations and 16 features.

The project follows a structured approach:

## 1. Data Preparation
The data is preprocessed to optimize its quality and relevance.

## 2. Model Training
Different neural network architectures and regularization techniques are explored, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## 3. Evaluation
The modelâ€™s performance is validated through training, development, and test sets, with accuracy and loss metrics guiding the optimization of hyperparameters.

For more details on the dataset and model, please refer to the Google Colaboratory notebook and the accompanying PDF report.
